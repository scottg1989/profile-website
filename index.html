          <h3>Junior Developer<br />May 2011 - April 2012</h3>
          <p>At Magnetic North, I formed part of a development team which developed cloud-based contact centre solutions, including call recording, predictive dialling, and PCI compliance packages. Alongside developing & supporting the existing products, I also spearheaded a small team to develop a new product. This was a new venture for the company, and as such it was important that it was created quickly, to a high standard, and would stand up against competing software. We delivered this project on time, to budget, and to a high standard.</p>

          <p>After looking for a simple and user-friendly money management app for my own use, I was unable to find one which I liked on the Google Play store. I decided to make an app that focused on being easy to use, and which allowed for quick entry of data. Since the first version was released, further features have been added in an effort to keep it competitive with other apps in the store.</p>
